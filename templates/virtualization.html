        <p>This project leverages virtualization technologies such as VMware and VirtualBox for multiple purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Development:</strong> Developers use VMs to create isolated environments for new features and testing, ensuring compatibility across various operating systems without affecting their main workstations.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Automated tests are run in virtual machines to simulate different environments and ensure the software performs as expected under various conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> By utilizing VMs, the deployment process can be standardized, and applications can be deployed consistently across different virtual environments, reducing the complexity of deployment and potential errors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Virtual machines offer a flexible, controlled setting for development, testing, and deployment, significantly improving the efficiency and reliability of software delivery.</p>
